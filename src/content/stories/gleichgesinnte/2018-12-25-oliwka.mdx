The friendship we have has always been tenuous. But the fragility of it also tends to be something that defines it, or rather, is characteristic of it. Etched with periods of quietness, and momentary spikes of stimulating conversations etch the landscape of amicability. The etches marked different epochs within the span of our friendship.

That is not to say I speak of us in a negative light but one of admiration and respect. She has helped me grow as a person. Perhaps we do not correspond or relate with each other at a level that I had expected or desired but that very same tenuous link represents the fragility of relationships as a whole, and of how we, or rather I take them for granted.
