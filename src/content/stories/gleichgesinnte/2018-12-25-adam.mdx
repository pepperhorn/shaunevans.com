## It's Time To Play The Music .. It's Time To Light The Lights!
Growing up in the '80s there were a few universal truths that were common to most North American kids -- and probably many kids around the world:

1. Everyone wanted a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Wheel_(tricycle)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Wheel</a>
2. You were probably captured on film in your standard issue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OshKosh_B'gosh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OshKosh overalls</a>
3. And your family would always tune into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zaQgbACc1E&pp=ygUXdGhlIG11cHBldCBzaG93IG9wZW5pbmc%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Muppet Show</a> on Monday nights.

### It ain't Sims
I don't know if you'd have guessed it, but my first inpiration was Zoot -- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko_jGjHja_c&list=RDko_jGjHja_c&start_radio=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but his last name wasn't Sims</a>.  It was the amazing (and strangely Miles Davis-inspired) Zoot from the Muppets.

It must have been Christmas '84 and 4 year old Shaun was enamored already by the great Zoot, Dr. Teeth, Janis, Animal and the gang.  But it was this year's hot toy from Fisher Price that I unwrapped under the tree and instantly fell in love:
