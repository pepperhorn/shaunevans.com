## The Alma Synth
I originally saw this on the amazing <a href="https://hackaday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hackaday</a> blog -- keen maker Alastair Roberts decided that he would <a href="https://bitsnpieces.dev/posts/a-synth-for-my-daughter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">build a 4 step sequencer for his toddler daughter</a>.  

The concept that really caught my attention was the use of sliders to control the pitch of the notes in each step -- higher the slider, the higher the pitch.  Lower the slider, the lower the pitch -- it's so simple.

The encoders handle things like note repeat, voice selection (a bunch of different sounds to choose from) and changing the scale from major to minor.  

Have a look at the video below to see it in action -- it's a joy to watch and the sound is absolutely amazing.  His process of iteration and moving to a printed PCB was also cool to see.  

It definitely sparked my interest for a software iteration of this concept with 4 step 'blocks' that can be tacked together, mixed and matched and looped to build song ideas for young composers and improvisers.  Watch this space!! ;)
