## About Shaun
Shaun Evans is a Woodwind and Keyboard player, composer, arranger and orchestrator who is the Chief Editor and Director of Macedon Ranges-based businesses PepperHorn Music, the Ranges Music Network and Ranges Events.   

Shaun’s professional career started in his teens in Canada, playing with local Big Bands and function bands in St. Catharines.  At 17 he moved to Miami, Florida to join Carnival Cruise Lines and began five years as a musician and Musical Director with CCL and Royal Caribbean, working with legendary artists such as the Drifters, Platters, Joe Sample, Roy Ayers, Ru Paul and many more.

He spent the rest of his 20s as a freelance arranger, studio and tour musician and Musical Director in the US, Mexico and Asia before moving to Australia in 2005 with his wife, Samantha.  Shaun founded PepperHorn Music in 2010 and continues to support and grow this innovative digital sheet music publisher.  PepperHorn’s new ‘Empowering Writers’ program received Federal Government funding in 2021 through the Victorian Industry Music Recovery Fund to help creatives leverage their intellectual property into new, passive income streams through publishing.

The Evans’ now live in the beautiful Macedon Ranges with their two daughters where Shaun has become heavily involved in the local music scene.  He worked with Braemar College for four years as Director of Music and is a founding member of the not-for-profit Macedon Ranges Music Collective.  

In addition to PepperHorn, Shaun is founded an accessible and inclusive in-school music program, the Ranges Music Network, which has grown to work with 12 local schools and over 200 young musicians.  

Together with long-time colleagues Oscar Lenain and Amethyst Jane, the trio gave birth to a new charitable foundation -- The Creative Ranges Foundation.  The CRF will continue the Ranges Music Network vision of accessible and inclusive music education, broadening to include the whole of the creative arts + making, coding, robotics and STEAM.  The Foundation will also be an active publisher of music education resources, apps, sheet music, games and a SASS platform for managing arts organizations.  

Shaun is a consummate entrepreneur, with broad visions for the cross-section of The Arts and technology.  He is excited for the future of artifical intelligence and the role it will play in the creative industries and is actively experimenting with AI's role in providing support, guidance and connecting the dots for educators and students.

As a publisher and intellectual property steward, Shaun is also looking to advances in DeFi, NFTs and tokenization to democratize the distribution of his and other artists' works -- empowering the creative classes with the ability to quickly monetize, distribute, derive, remix and create new revenue streams from their catalog.
