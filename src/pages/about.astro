            Shaun Evans is a Woodwind and Keyboard player, composer, arranger and orchestrator who is the Chief Editor and Director of <a href="https://pepperhorn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PepperHorn Music</a> -- the internationally acclaimed digital sheet music publisher.  He is an accomplished music educator and thought leader who founded both the <a href="https://creativeranges.org/schools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ranges Music Network</a> (a progressive Primary School music program and curriculum) and was one of the founding Directors and first CEO of the <a href="https://creativeranges.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Ranges Foundation</a>.</p>   
	<p>Shaun’s professional career started in his teens in Canada, playing with local Big Bands and function bands in St. Catharines.  He was a young apprentice with the <a href="https://niagarasymphony.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niagara Symphony Orchestra</a>, principal clarinet with the <a href="https://niagaryouthorchestra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niagara Youth Orchestra</a> and later an associate with the Symphony.  At 17 he moved to Miami, Florida to join <a href="https://carnival.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnival Cruise Line</a> and began five years as a musician and Musical Director with CCL and <a href="https://royalcaribbean.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royal Caribbean</a>, working with legendary artists such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Drifters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Drifters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Platters</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Sample" target="_blank">Joe Sample</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Ayers">Roy Ayers</a>, and even opening for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul" target="_blank">RuPaul</a> and many more.</p>
	<p>He spent the rest of his 20s as a freelance arranger, studio and tour musician and Musical Director in the US, Mexico and Southeast Asia before moving to Australia in 2005 with his now wife, Samantha.  
    <p>Shaun founded <a href="https://pepperhorn.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PepperHorn Music</a> in 2010 and continues to support and grow this innovative digital sheet music publisher through partnerships with international publishers and distributors such as <a href="https://mu.se">Muse Group</a>'s <a href="https://www.halleonard.com/">Hal Leonard</a> and <a href="https://fabermusic.co.uk">Faber Music UK</a>.  PepperHorn’s new ‘Empowering Writers’ program received Federal Government funding in 2021 through the <a href="https://www.creative.vic.gov.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Victoria</a> Victorian Industry Music Recovery Fund to help creatives leverage their intellectual property into new, passive income streams through publishing.  PepperHorn is always actively developing in new directions including educational resources and tools, software as a service (SaSS) platforms, AI and blockchain technologies with the aim of democratizing publishing and royalties for the creative class</p>
	<p>The Evans’ now live in the beautiful Macedon Ranges with their two daughters where Shaun has become heavily involved in the local music scene.  He worked with <a href="https://braemar.vic.edu.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Braemar College Woodend</a> for four years as Director of Music and is a founding member of the not-for-profit <strong>Macedon Ranges Music Collective</strong>.</p>
	<p>After leaving Braemar and just as the COVID pandemic set in in early 2020, Shaun assembled a team of local music education all-stars to create an accessible and inclusive in-school music program, the <strong>Ranges Music Network</strong>.  The program was committed to giving all learners the time and space to develop, grow, be curious and explore all aspects of music.  This especially included reflecting and constantly innovating on our approach to teaching to support and scaffold every style of musical learner, especially those with neurodiversity and socio-emotional regulatory needs. The Ranges Music Network blossomed into a program with over 150 music makers across a dozen schools offering both individual and ensembled based instruction models.  The organization also supported a number of community based ensembles and events including the MRSC Christmas Roving entertainers, Discover Woodend Day, feature shows and festivals.</p>
	<p>As the RMN program entered it's fourth year and continued to grow, Shaun and the team saw the need to set the organization up for continued success and sustainability.  Together, they formed the not-for-profit <strong>Creative Ranges Foundation</strong>.  Through a generous gift from the Macedon Ranges Music Collective, the Foundation was able to achieve charity (deductible gift receipient) status and set out to establish a creative arts learning hub in Woodend.  Shaun's company donated the assets of the Ranges Music Collective to jump-start the new Foundation and the organization rebranded the education program as the <a href="https://creativeranges.org/schools">Creative Ranges Network</a> in mid-2025 -- now serving over 200 young musicians with a team of 12 music educators and support staff.</p>  
    <p>The CRF is committed to providing accessible and inclusive music education to all learners across the Macedon Ranges and beyond through their new online platform, <a href="https://be.creativeranges.org">be.creativeranges.org</a>.  The Foundation is also committed to supporting and growing the local music scene and community by providing resources, tools and opportunities for all musicians to develop and grow.  The Foundation is also committed to supporting and growing the local music scene and community by providing resources, tools and opportunities for all musicians to develop and grow.</p>
    <p>Shaun is an independent music publisher who records and publishes both his own music and supports young and emerging talent through the Macedon Ranges to record and develop their own musical vision.  He continues to work with the Creative Ranges Foundation as a Board Member and as a mentor and clinician for the next generation of upcoming musicians.</p>
    <p>He became an Australian citizen in 2022 and is now a dual Canadian-Australian citizen.</p></div>

          <p>
            Shaun's experience as a music educator has born the urgency to find new pathways for all creatives to learn and grow.  The birth of the AI age will provide a valuable toolset for education through insights, inspiration and individualized learning pathways.<p>
                <p>Similary, his experience as a music publisher has lead to interest in blockchain and DeFi technologies to empower the creative class to monetize their work and create new revenue streams from their ip and catalog.  The power of smart contracts and tokenization of real world assets allow for automated and decentralized royalties and licensing, split across multiple stakeholders in a transparent and equitable way.  This is a new paradigm that, if implemented correctly and with the minimal amount of user friction will empower a new generation of artists and makers to create, share and earn from the dividens of their creative output.</p>.
